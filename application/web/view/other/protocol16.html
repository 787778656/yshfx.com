        <p>A) TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
        <p>协议条款</p><br>
        <p>1. THE SERVICES WE WILLPROVIDE</p>
        <p>我司提供的服务</p><br>
        <p>We will be subject to the rules and regulations of the FCA and will provide you with an execution
        only dealing service in foreign exchange, bullion contracts and contracts for differences in indices
        ("Contracts") offered by AUSFOREX.</p>
        <p>我司受英国 FCA 的全面监管。我司为您提供的外汇、贵金属合约及指数的差价合约（下统称 “合约”）
        的交易服务性质为“仅执行”。</p><br>
        <p>Both AUSFOREX and the Client will enter into contracts as principal. You shall be directly and
        personally responsible for performing your obligations under every transaction entered into
        between us, whether you are dealing as principal directly or through an agent, or as agent for
        another person, and you shall indemnify us in respect of all liabilities, losses or costs of any kind
        or nature whatsoever which may be incurred by us as a direct or indirect result of any failure by
        you to perform any such obligation.</p>
        <p>所有合约不论买卖皆为您与我司之间，各为主体的交易。您应直接以个人名义负责，按我司之间的每宗交
        易所订，履行您的义务，不论您直接为交易主体或通过经纪人或作为其它人士的经纪人。您都须就因您未
        能履行该义务而直接或间接产生的任何负债、损失、及来自我司的任何费用向我司作出赔偿。</p><br>
        <p>All orders placed and instructions given by you for the services will be subject to these terms. All
        other terms and conditions which you may try to introduce under any order, confirmation of
        order or similar are excluded any of the services may be provided using the services of third
        parties, including our affiliates who may act as agents for us.</p>
        <p>您为获取服务而发布的一切合约和指示，都要遵循这些条款。这些条款不包括您根据合约、合约确认书或
        类似文件而希望引入的条款。我司所提供的服务可能是来自第三方的服务，其中包括我司的代理所提供的
        服务。</p><br>
        <p>The services may involve margined transactions, where the Client is required to deposit cash to
        secure performance of the Client’s obligations under the contract. The Client acknowledges,
        recognizes and understands that all transactions are subject to and in accordance with the
        relevant Market Rules prevalent from time to time. In particular the Client acknowledges that
        Market Rules usually contain wide powers in an emergency or otherwise undesirable situation.</p>
        <p>这些服务可能包含保证金交易，您需要存入规定的现金，来确保履行合约义务。您需要了解并同意，所有
        交易的进行都要依照即时市场准则进行。需要指出，市场准则通常包含当紧急和其他特殊情况发生时扩展
        权利的情况，您需要了解这一点。</p><br>
        <p>We may amend, suspend and/or terminate any or all of the services at any time for any valid
        reason. Where reasonably practicable we will give advance notice of this but this may not always
        be possible and/or practical for business reasons.</p>
        <p>出于合理原因，我司会随时更改、暂停终止所有服务。在进行上述操作前，如果可以联系到您，我司会提
        前告知您。在无法告知您的情况下，我司保留不承担任何责任的权利。</p><br>
        <p>2. EXECUTION</p>
        <p>仅执行交易服务之安排</p><br>
        <p>AUSFOREX will provide only an execution only dealing service; we will not provide investment
        advice to you. If we enter into a Contract with you this shall not be taken to mean that AUSFOREX
        recommends, or concurs on the merits of, the Contract or that the Contract is suitable for you.
        Also，AUSFOREX does not give any trading or market recommendations, advice or instructions in
        its communications.</p>
        <p>请注意，我司并不会就特定交易的优点作出建议，当您就某合约发出交易指示时，我司合理地相信您并不
        预期得到该等建议，而您是以“仅执行”的性质进行交易。同时，AUSFOREX 不会在交流过程中给您任何
        交易推荐、建议及指示。</p><br>
        <p>3. CREDIT</p>
        <p>信贷</p><br>
        <p>Details of any credit arrangement that may be available to you shall be set out in and shall be
        subject to such terms and conditions and limits as may be agreed in separate correspondence.
        Your credit limit should be no more than the total amount you are prepared to and can afford to
        lose. If any Contracts exceed the credit or any other limit placed upon your dealings, we may
        bring to an end all or any of the contracts pursuant to Term 4 in order to bring your liability back
        within the credit limit. We may at our absolute discretion extend additional credit to you if you fail
        to meet a margin call, but the availability and suitability of such credit will depend upon the
        outcome of our reassessment of your financial circumstances.</p>
        <p>任何由我司提供给您的授信安排，需视乎经双方协商而定的所有条款、条件和限制，其细则将另函列出。
        您的信用限额应该不超过您预算及能够承担的损失的总金额。如果您的合约超过了信用限额或任何其它交
        易限额，我司可按条款 4 所述终止全部或任何合约，以将您的负债维持在信用限额内。如您未能达到追加
        保证金要求，我司有绝对酌情权提高您的信用限额，但我司需视乎对您的财务状况重新评估的结果，以决
        定其可能性及适合性。</p><br>
        <p>4. MARGININGARRANGEMENTS</p>
        <p>保证金安排</p><br>
        <p>The client shall pay to AUSFOREX on demand:</p>
        <p>客户需按要求支付 AUSFOREX 下列资金：</p><br>
        <p>i) Such sums of money by way of deposits or as initial margin or variation margin as AUSFOREX
        may require.</p>
        <p>i) 我司要求您存入作为起始保证金及变动保证金之用的一定数额资金。</p><br>
        <p>ii) Such sums of money as may from time to time be due to AUSFOREX under a contract and such
        sums as may be required in or towards clearance of any debit.</p>
        <p>ii) 我司根据合约，每隔一段时间要求您支付的，作为结算账户所欠账目的一定数额资金。</p><br>
        <p>iii) Such sums of money as AUSFOREX may from time to time require as security for the Client’s
        obligations to AUSFOREX. You may be required to make margin payments sufficient to meet the
        amount which, when a movement adverse to your contract has taken place, you would lose on
        the contract if it were brought to an end on the basis of our current quotation for the contract
        concerned. Our determination of the current market value and the amount of additional and/or
        variation margin shall be conclusive and shall not be challenged by you. The call for margin or
        extra margin will be made by any available means (telephone, fax or e-mail). If made by e-mail, it
        will be to your designated e-mail address and it will not in that case be confirmed by telephone
        or fax or letter, save in exceptional circumstances and then only in our absolute discretion.</p>
        <p>iii) 每隔一段时间，AUSFOREX 会要求您支付的，作为客户履约保证的一定数额资金。在与我司交易的过
        程中，除非另有协议，您必须在进行合约交易之前先将款项存入。当您持有的合约遇到市况逆转，您必须
        支付足够的保证金以应付该合约以实时市场报价计算而可能出现的亏损。我司对当前市场价值及追加保证
        金的金额，将为最终的依据及不得有任何争议。追加保证金或增加保证金的通知会以任何可使用的方法（电
        话、传真或电邮）向您发出。如果是通过电子邮件传达，会发到您指定的电子邮件地址，在这种情况下，
        我司将不再通过电话、传真或信函来确认，除非出现异常情况，我司有绝对酌情处理权。</p><br>
        <p>Please note we will not accept any third party payments made in respect of funding your account.
        Similarly we will not pay out any funds from your account to any third parties.</p>
        <p>请注意，我司拒绝任何由第三者支付的存款，同时我司拒绝客户转账或提款到第三者的账户。</p><br>
        <p>If the client fails to provide any margin, deposit or other sum due in respect of any transaction
        AUSFOREX may close all open contracts without prior notice.</p>
        <p>如果客户没能提供足够保证金，存款或其他对应的抵押品以维持客户未平仓合约，在避免客户面临更大程
        度损失的考虑下我司有权将您的未平仓合约部分或全部平仓而不会预先通知。</p><br>
        <p>5. CHARGESAND COMMISSIONS</p>
        <p>费用与佣金</p><br>
        <p>We will agree with you before entering into any contract, the amount of our commission which
        will be shown on the statement sent to you. Commission rates shall be those prevailing at the
        time. Commissions and charges may be changed from time to time without prior notice to you.
        We may have soft commission agreements in place. It is our policy to affect these where they are
        commercially efficient in accordance with market practice.</p>
        <p>在您参与任何合约交易之前，我司会跟您就佣金的金额达成共识，并列于对账单上。佣金率应为当时所定
        的佣金率。所收取的佣金或会不时作出修订而不会作事先通知。我司或会有软性佣金协议安排。我司会按
        市场规律视乎其商业效率而使之生效。</p><br>
        <p>6. INTEREST/ROLLOVER</p>
        <p>利息</p><br>
        <p>No interest will be credited in respect of any monies held on account or for margin payments,
        which will be held by us in a client bank account. A finance fee will be charged or credited to your
        account with us depending on the nature of the open positions you hold, the contract concerned
        and the rates of interest prevailing in that contract. When you open a contract position, we will
        calculate the amount of interest that would be earned on the money necessary to take out the
        relevant position in the underlying investment, at a rate notified to you in mail. While your
        Contract position remains open the amount of interest will be calculated and will accrue on a
        daily basis.</p>
        <p>在我司的银行账户中运作的任何存款或保证金都不需支付利息。另外，根据您的持仓、相关合约及合约利
        息率的不同性质，可能从您的账户中扣除或向您的账户支付相应的财务费用。当您持有未平仓合约，我司
        会计算投资到其基础产品所涉资金所产生的利息，将相关利率以邮件通知您。当您持有未平仓合约，利息
        则会每日计算及滚存。</p><br>
        <p>7. POSITION LIMIT</p>
        <p>持仓限制</p><br>
        <p>AUSFOREX reserves the right to limit the number of positions which may be opened or
        maintained by the Client in his account. We also reserve the right to decline to accept any
        additional orders after the limit has been exceeded, and to liquidate all or part of the surpassed
        positions there after.</p>
        <p>我司保留权利在任何指定的时间限制您账户内的净持仓量，不论多仓或空仓，由我司酌情处理。当净持仓
        量的上限到达后，我司有权拒绝开立新的合同，我司有权酌情把超过净持仓量上限的合约平仓。</p><br>
        <p>8. EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY</p>
        <p>免责声明</p><br>
        <p>No claim shall be made against AUSFOREX or any associated company of us or any employee of
        us to recover any loss or damage which you may suffer or incur by reason of the carrying out by
        us of our obligations under this agreement provided that such loss or damage does not arise
        from the negligence or willful default of AUSFOREX, its associates or employees.</p>
        <p>如非因为我司的过失或故意违反而导致或我司在根据协议履行责任的过程中导致您损失，您都无权要求我
        司或任何我司的联营公司或雇员赔偿。</p><br>
        <p>9. AUTHORISATIONAND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS</p>
        <p>授权和其它通信</p><br>
        <p>Except where you expressly instruct us otherwise, we shall be entitled to rely on and act in
        accordance with any instructions, requests and notices (whether or not in mail and howsoever
        communicated) given or purported to be given by any individual or person who purports to be or
        is reasonably believed by us to be an agent, attorney or otherwise authorized by you. We may in
        our absolute discretion and without explanation to you refuse to act upon any instruction,
        particularly if we believe that it may not be practical or acting on the instruction would in our
        opinion infringe any law, rule, regulation or condition of this agreement or, in the case of
        instructions received from an agent if we reasonably believe that such agent may be acting in
        excess of his authority.</p>
        <p>除非您另外明确地指示我司，否则我司将有权信任自称或使我司合理地相信是您的代理人的任何个体或人
        士，授权人或您以其它方式授权的人，所给予或自称受其给予的指示，要求，及通知（不论是以邮件或任
        何通讯形式），而作出相应的行动。我司有绝对酌情权亦无须向您解释，可拒绝任何我司认为不可行的，
        或违反法例、条例、监管或本协议内的条款的，或由您的代理人发出但我司认为已超越其权限的指示，作
        出相应的行动。</p><br>
        <p>Additional dealing procedures may be provided by us to you from time to time none of which
        form part of this agreement.</p>
        <p>我司会不时向您提示额外的交易程序，但不应将之视作本协议的一部份。</p><br>
        <p>If at any time you are unable for whatever reason, to communicate with us we shall not be
        responsible for any loss, damage or cost caused to you by any act, error, delay or omission
        resulting there from where such loss, damage or cost is a result of your inability to enter into a
        transaction, and except where your inability to instruct us or communicate with us results from
        our fraud, willful default or gross negligence, be responsible for any loss, damage or cost
        caused to you by any act error or omission or delay resulting there from including without
        limitation, where such loss, damage or cost is a result of your inability to close a transaction.</p>
        <p>无论基于任何理由，任何时候您无法与我司保持联系，我司将不会为因任何行动、错失、延误、疏忽而使
        您未能开始某项交易而蒙受损失，损害或成本负责。不会为因任何行动、错失、延误、疏忽而使您未能结
        束某项交易而蒙受损失，损害或成本负责；除非我司因诈骗、故意违反或严重过失，而导致您未能向我司
        指示。</p><br>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that any instruction and communication transmitted by you or on
        your behalf is made at your risk and you authorized us to rely and act on, and treat as fully
        authorized and binding upon you, any instruction (whether or not in mail) which we believe in
        good faith to have been given by you or on your behalf by any agent or intermediary whom we
        believe in good faith to have been duly authorized by you.</p>
        <p>您确认并同意须为您或以您名义发出的任何指示承担风险。您并授权我司对任何我司诚意相信由您或您的
        代理人以您名义，或我司诚意相信为您适当地授权的中介人所发出的指示，可信任及作相应行动，及视作
        被授以全权及具法律约束力的。</p><br>
        <p>You agree that we may record all telephone conversations between you and us and that we may
        use such recordings or transcripts from such recordings, as evidence in any dispute or anticipated
        dispute between you and us.</p>
        <p>您同意我司记录所有通话记录，作为可能产生的纠纷的证明。</p><br>
        <p>10. CHANGES IN TERMS</p>
        <p>更改条款</p><br>
        <p>These terms and conditions are subject to change at any time by us sending you a written notice
        describing the relevant change(s). Such change(s) will become effective on a date specified in the
        notice which will be at least 10 days after the date on which the notice is deemed to be received
        by you. No such change will affect any legal rights or obligations which may previously have
        accrued to or been incurred by you or us.</p>
        <p>本协议的条款和条件可能在任何时候作出更改，我司会以邮件形式通知您有关更改的细节。这些更改事项
        至少会在我司通知您 10 天后开始生效，生效日期将会在通知中特别声明。这些更改并不会影响我司和您
        之间原有的法律权利和义务。</p><br>
        <p>11. STOPAND LIMIT ORDERS</p>
        <p>止损和限价指令</p><br>
        <p>We may in our absolute discretion accept an instruction (a “stop order” or “limit order”) from
        you to open or close any Contract when our quote in respect of the relevant investment, or (as
        the case may be) an underlying market quotation relating thereto, reaches or goes beyond a level
        specified by you. You may specify that such an instruction is to apply for a limited duration or for
        an indefinite period (a “Good Till Cancelled” or “GTC” order). If we accept a Stop or Limit Order
        then, when the level of our current quote or (as the case may be) the relevant market quotation
        relating thereto reaches or goes beyond the level of your Stop or Limit Order, provided that the
        conditions in this paragraph are satisfied your instruction will be executed automatically at the
        level of your Stop or Limit Order. You acknowledge that where the underlying market is moving
        rapidly our quote may have gone beyond the level of your Stop or Limit Order by the time your
        order is executed.</p>
        <p>我司有绝对酌情权接受您的指示（“止损”或“限价”指示）以开始或结束任何合约，如果有关产品的报
        价或（在某些情况下）其相关资产的市场价格已达到或超过您所设定的水平。您可设定该指示只适用于某
        个期限或不设期限（即“有效直到取消”指示）。如果我司接受了您的止损或限价指示，当有关产品的报
        价或（在某些情况下）其相关资产的市场价格已达到或超过您的止损或限价指示所设定的水平时，在符合
        本段所述的条件下，您的止损或限价指示会在所设定的水平自动执行。</p><br>
        <p>Limit Order by the time your order is executed. You may with our prior consent (and such consent
        will not be unreasonably withheld) cancel or amend the level of Stop or Limit Order at any time
        before our quote or the relevant market quotation reaches or goes beyond the relevant level.
        However, once the level has been reached you may not cancel or amend the level of order. If you
        enter into any Contract and place a Stop or Limit Order which, when executed, would be capable
        of closing or partly closing such Contract and you subsequently instruct us to close that Contract,
        or any part of it prior to the level of the Stop or Limit Order being reached, it is your responsibility
        to cancel the Stop or Limit Order if you do not want the order to remain valid. If you close your
        original Contract and fail to cancel the Stop or Limit Order we shall be entitled in our absolute
        discretion to treat the Stop or Limit Order as an instruction to enter into a new Contract for you
        once our quote or (as the case may be) the relevant market quotation reaches or goes beyond the
        level of the Stop or Limit Order.</p>
        <p>您应了解市场价格瞬息万变，当您的指令在执行过程中，我司的报价很可能已经超过了您之前的止损或限
        价指令的设定价格，因此在出现这种情况之前，您可在得到我司事先同意后（我司不会无故不同意），在
        我司的报价或其相关市场价格达到您所设定的水平之前的任何时间，取消或修改止损或限价指示的水平。
        但是，一旦达到设定的价格，您便不能再取消或修改指令价格。如您发出的止损或限价指示，使其在执行
        时会结束您持有的某些合约的全部或部分时，但其后在达到止损或限价指示设定的水平之前，您另行指示
        我司将该合约的全部或部分平仓；如您不想该止损或限价指示继续有效，您有责任自行将其取消。如您已
        将该合约平仓而没有取消该止损或限价指示，当我司的报价或（在某些情况下）相关的市场报价达到或超
        过该止损或限价指示所订的水平时，我司将享有绝对酌情权将该止损或限价指示视为您要开始新合约的指
        示。</p><br>
        <p>The conditions referred to in this paragraph are as follows:</p>
        <p>本段所指的条件如下：</p><br>
        <p>· When you instruct us to close part but not all of a Contract entered into, both the part of the
        Contract which you instruct us to close and the part which would remain open if we carried out
        your instruction must not be smaller than the minimum size advised by us to you from time to
        time;</p>
        <p>· 当您指示我司结束部分而不是全部之前的合约时，一旦我司执行您的指令，无论是您指示我司结束的部
        分还是仍然保持未平仓状态的部分，其数量都不能小于我司指定的最小单位；</p><br>
        <p>· A Force Majeure Event must not have occurred;</p>

        of which you instruct us to open or close the Contract.</p>

        <p>Each Contract and all other transactions entered into between us and you under this agreement

        <p>AUSFOREX does not claim any account information to customers, please safekeeping your
        account and password, and ensure that any of your transactions are motivated by your

        <p>A. FUTURES</p>
        <p>未来</p><br>
        <p>Transactions in futures involve the obligation to make, or take delivery of the underlying asset of
        the contract at a future date, or in some cases to settle your position with cash. They carry a high
        degree of risk. The “gearing” or “leverage” often obtainable in futures trading means that a
        small deposit or down payment can lead to large losses as well as gains. It also means that a
        relatively small market movement can lead to a proportionally much larger movement in the
        value of your investment, and this can work against you as well as for you. Futures transactions
        have a contingent liability and you should be aware of the implications of this, in particular the
        margining requirements.</p>
        <p>未来交易涉及在未来的一个日期将合约的相关资产的交收义务；或在某些情况，以现金结算。此类交易存
        在高度风险。在未来交易中往往得到“杠杆效应”，代表以小量的存款或订金可导致重大的损失或收益。
        这亦可理解为一些相对小型的市场波动可引致您的投资价值上远远较大比例的波动，而这波动可能对您不
        利或有利。未来交易存在或然责任，您亦对此含意有所警觉，特别在保证金要求方面。</p><br>
        <p>B. CONTRACTS FOR DIFFERENCE</p>
        <p>差价合约</p><br>
        <p>Futures and Options contracts can also be referred to as contracts for difference. These can be
        options and/or futures on the FTSE 100 index or any other index or share, commodity or currency.
        However, unlike other futures and options, these contracts can only be settled in cash. Investing
        in contracts for difference carries the same risks as investing in a future or an option and you
        should be aware of these as set out in paragraphs A respectively. Transactions in contracts for
        difference may also have a contingent liability and you should be aware of the implications of
        this.</p>
        <p>未来及期权合约皆可被视为差价合约。金融时报 100 指数或其它指数或股份、商品、外汇的未来及期权皆
        可作差价合约。但与其它未来及期权不同之处，差价合约只作现金结算。投资差价合约与投资未来或期权
        存在同等风险，您应注意上述 A 段所列的风险。差价合约交易也许包含或然责任，而您亦应对此含意有所
        警觉。</p><br>
        <p>18. INTERNET DEALING</p>
        <p>网上交易</p><br>
        <p>You acknowledge that the internet is, due to unpredictable traffic congestion and other reasons,
        an inherently unreliable medium of communication and that such unreliability is beyond our
        control;</p>
        <p>由于不可预知的信息传输拥塞及其他因素，互联网自身是一种有风险的通讯媒介，这种风险不在我司的控
        制范围；</p><br>
        <p>Trading on the internet is not instantaneous and several seconds may elapse between the time
        when you give your order via the internet to us and the time when it is received by us, in which
        time the market may have moved and your order may be implemented at a different value from
        that when you initiated the order on your PC;</p>
        <p>网上交易存在延时，当您通过网络下达交易指令到我司接受到您的交易指令时，在短暂的瞬间内，市场行
        情已经有所变化，您的交易将会以一个不同意您最初在您计算机终端发出的交易价格的价位执行；</p><br>
        <p>We reserve the right not to execute an order by you until it has been received by us;</p>
        <p>在没有收到您的交易指令之前，我司保留拒绝您执行交易指令的权利；</p><br>
        <p>We shall not be liable for any loss, expense, cost or liability (including consequential loss) suffered
        or incurred by you as a result of instructions being given or any other communications being
        made via e-mail or via the internet;</p>
        <p>我司将不会对您通过电子邮件或网络下达的交易指令所造成或导致的任何损失、费用、成本、负债（包括
        持续的损失）负责；</p><br>
        <p>You will solely be responsible for all orders and for the accuracy of all information sent via the
        internet using your name or personal identification number;</p>
        <p>您必须为您的用户名或者身份证号码通过网络发送的所有交易及相关信息的准确性负责；</p><br>
        <p>You further acknowledge and agree that there are risks of misunderstandings or errors in any
        communication and that such risks shall be absolutely borne by you;</p>
        <p>由于诸多沟通误解和沟通失误所造成的风险由您个人承担；</p><br>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that it shall not usually be possible to cancel an instruction after it
        has been given;</p>
        <p>您同意您的交易指令一旦下达，该交易指令通常将不可能被取消；</p><br>
        <p>The time shown by our electronic logging system and the information contained on our server
        shall be conclusive between us as to the exact time of receipt of any messages or order and as to
        the accuracy of the information.</p>
        <p>显示在 AUSFOREX 电子登陆系统上的时间及系统中包含的信息将会是我们之间校对任何收据信息的确切
        时间及信息的准确性的决定性参考依据。</p><br>
        <p>19. FORCE MAJEURE EVENTS</p>
        <p>不可抗拒的事件</p><br>
        <p>We may, in our reasonable opinion, determine that an emergency or an exceptional market
        condition exists (a“Force Majeure Event”). A Force Majeure Event shall include, but is not limited
        to, the following:</p>
        <p>在合理解释的前提下，我们可能会认定某个紧急状态或是某个一场市场情况（我们称之为 “不可抗拒的”
        事情）的存在。不可抗拒的事件可能包括但不完全限于下列情况：</p><br>
        <p>‧ Any act, event or occurrence (including without limitation any strike, riot or civil commotion,
        hostilities, foreign intervention, governmental actions, natural disaster, Act of God, an
        interruption of power supply or electronic or communication equipment failure) which, in our
        opinion, prevents us from maintaining an orderly market in one or more of the investments in
        respect of which we ordinarily deal in Contracts;</p>
        <p>‧ 罢工、暴乱或骚乱、敌对、国外干预、政府行动、自然灾害、朝拜运动、电力供应中断或电路及通讯设
        施损毁。这些情况下，我们认为无法按照合同约定在一个或更多投资地维持正常交易；</p><br>
        <p>‧ The suspension or closure of any market or the abandonment or failure of any event upon
        which we base, or to which we in any way relate our quote, or the imposition of limits or special or
        unusual terms on the trading in any such market or in any such event;</p>
        <p>‧ 运营中止或关闭的市场，或是任何其他涉及我们的搁置或失败的事件，以及在此事件或市场中强加的限
        制或特殊、非正常的贸易条款；</p><br>
        <p>‧ The occurrence of any excessive movement in the level of any Contract and/or the underlying
        market or our anticipation (acting reasonably) of the occurrence of such movements.</p>
        <p>‧ 发生任何超出合同规定的和/或基础市场限度的过度行为，或是我们预料到的（合理发生的）此类事件。</p><br>
        <p>If we determine that a Force Majeure Event exists we may in our absolute discretion without
        notice and at any time take one or more of the following steps:</p>
        <p>一旦认定某一事件为不可抗拒的事件，我们可能将在不告知客户的情况下，慎重采取下列一到多步措施：</p><br>
        <p>‧ Increase your deposit requirements;</p>
        <p>‧ 提高您的存款准备金；</p><br>
        <p>‧ Close any or all of your open Contracts at such closing level as we reasonably believe to be
        appropriate;</p>
        <p>‧ 在合理情况下，我们会终止您的一个或所有已开立交易合约；</p><br>
        <p>‧ Suspend or modify the application of all or any of the terms of this agreement to the extent that
        the Force Majeure Event makes it impossible or impractical for us to comply with the term or
        terms in question;</p>
        <p>‧ 本条款的终止或调整，或是不可抗拒的事件导致我们无法正常或完全无法履行该条款的相关内容；</p><br>
        <p>‧ Alter the last time for trading for a particular Contract;</p>
        <p>‧ 由于特定条款而该改变最后交易时间；</p><br>
        <p>‧ Take or omit to take all such other actions as we deem to be reasonably appropriate in the
        circumstances having t our position, your position and the positions of the other customers.</p>
        <p> ‧ 处于对我们和您还有其他客户利益的考虑，其它包括在上述情况或不在上述情况之列的情况，我们将视
        情况合理而定。</p><br>

        damage, costs and expenses, including lawyer’s fees, arising directly or indirectly out of such
        events.</p>

        <p>20. ENTRY INTO FORCE</p>
        <p>条款生效</p><br>
        <p>This Agreement shall not be deemed accepted by AUSFOREX and shall not become a binding
        contract between the Client and AUSFOREX until the Agreement and the Customer Account
        Application, including all relevant annexes, have been completed and executed by the Client and
        received and accepted by AUSFOREX, a notice whereof shall be given to the Customer.</p>

        <p>21. RISK WARNING & DISCLAIMER</p>
        <p>风险警告及免责声明</p><br>
        <p>The facilities we provide are available only to experienced investors with sufficient financial
        resources to trade in our investment products. The following statements are intended to make
        you aware of and disclose to you the potential risk and loss in respect to the trading on the
        financial markets. You must familiarize yourself with the nature of CFD trading, the terminology
        used and the procedures involved before you enter into any contract. Our rolling spot contracts
        and CFDs are based on highly leveraged margin trading; as with any derivative instrument, such
        contracts carry a very high degree of risk and trading such instruments may expose the investor
        to substantial losses as well as gains. The gearing and leverage that is obtainable with CFD
        trading means that you only need to place a small deposit to commence trading with us although
        this small deposit may result in large losses or large gains. You must consider that if the market
        moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the funds deposited. It is your
        responsibility to ensure that you are fully aware all these risks before enter into any contract.</p>
        <p>我们只接受有一定投资经验和财政状况良好的客户。以下声明列出了您在金融市场投资时可能面临的潜在
        风险和亏损。在做任何买卖前您必须了解差价合约的交易性质。我司的现货及差价合约均以高杠杆保证金
        为基础；正如任何衍生投资工具，该等合约涉及较高风险。您必须了解，使用该投资工具可能令您遭受巨
        额亏损或获得巨大回报。</p><br>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Agreement or the nature and suitability of the services we
        provide, please contact us before commencing any activity on your account. We will assume that,
        on commencement of business, you are satisfied that all terms relating to your facility with us
        have been fully understood and accepted by you. We will assess your application from the
        information available to us and in particular the responses you have given in completing the
        Customer Information Sheet; if you are accepted as a customer it will be on such a basis.
        Accordingly, we will classify you as a private customer. You should not proceed with this
        arrangement unless you have carefully considered that it is appropriate for you and are satisfied
        with these terms .Investors should note that to protect their interests, we may set zero stop
        orders where no client order has been placed to minimize losses. In this event, clients cannot lose
        more than their initial commitment.</p>
        <p>若您对此协议及我们提供的服务有任何疑问和建议，请在开设账户之前与我们联系，否则视为您接受该协
        议。我司相信本页所作之陈述及所发表之观点准确无误。在可能的范围内，AUSFOREX 并不就该等陈述及
        观点所出现的任何错误或遗漏承担任何责任。</p><br>
        <p>22. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</p>
        <p>利益冲突</p><br>
        <p>We provide herewith a summary of the policy we maintain in order to manage conflicts of interest
        in respect of the duties we owe to our clients.</p>
        <p>本着对客户负责的态度，我们制定该条款，用来处理利益冲突事件。我们努力建立、维系和运用有效的行
        政管理模式来最大化地、合理地解决利益冲突，努力避免因利益冲突而给我们客户造成不必要的物质损失。</p><br>
        <p>GENERAL</p>
        <p>基本信息</p><br>
        <p>A conflict of interest can arise between AUSFOREX and you as a client or between your interests
        and those of another client of ours. We aim to establish and maintain and operate effective
        organizational and administrative arrangements with a view to talking all reasonable steps to
        prevent conflicts of interest from constituting or giving rise to a material risk of damage to the
        interests of our clients.</p>
        <p>对于 AUSFOREX 与客户或者您与其他客户之间的利益冲突，我司会建立巩固一套可以高效运作的管理系
        统，通过一切合理可行的措施预防因利益冲突对客户利益造成实际伤害。</p><br>
        <p>OUR POLICY</p>
        <p>政策概述</p><br>
        <p>We aim to keep a record of the kinds of activity we carry on in which a material conflict could arise
        or has arisen, and, in doing so we take account of the activities of other members of our group of
        companies. We also maintain procedures to maintain appropriate independence between
        members of our staff who are involved in different activities, for example, through the operation
        of information barriers, the segregation of duties and responsibilities and maintenance of a policy
        of independence which requires our staff, when providing services to a client, to act in the best
        interests of the client and to disregard any conflicts of interest; and, in some circumstances
        declining to act for a client or potential client.</p>
        <p>我们会对预知的或已发生的物质冲突事件进行记录，并对参与此事件的其他员工的活动进行记录。此类事
        件中，我们也会采取措施确保参与其中的员工之间独立行事，例如信息隔离、职责分割等。我们也会确保
        一项条款的独立性，用来约束员工行为，确保他们在为客户提供服务时，从客户的利益出发，不受利益纠
        纷的影响。某些情况下，我们也会不干预客户或潜在客户的行为。</p><br>
        <p>DISCLOSURE: GENERAL</p>
        <p>信息透露概述</p><br>
        <p>Where our arrangements to manage conflicts are not or cannot be sufficient to be reasonably
        confident that risks of damage to a client’s interest will be prevented we aim to disclose the
        general nature and/or sources of conflicts before carrying on business for the client. This is to
        allow the client to consider whether to ask for more information and whether to continue with
        the service; we do not aim to provide detailed, highly specific or comprehensive information.</p>
        <p>在同客户开展业务前，我们一直努力避免可能损害客户利益的因素和诱因。然而，我们并不能保证完全避
        免此种事情的发生，并且对于发生利益冲突后的处理办法，也无法完全保证它的有效性。在这种情况下，
        客户可以要求了解更多信息，决定是否继续交易服务。</p><br>
        <p>GIFTAND HOSPITALITY</p>
        <p>赠品和友好接待</p><br>
        <p>We do not prohibit our staff from receiving small gifts and minor hospitality from other parties

        交易量的持仓时间低于 1 分钟时，或存在本公司禁止的使用高杠杆进行重仓短线高频交易或通过其他手段
        （例如锁仓交易）等以逃避上述之规定的交易行为时，此账户即被定义为异常交易。</p><br>

        trading according to the review results.</p>
